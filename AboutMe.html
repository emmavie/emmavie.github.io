    <h3> Hi, I'm a highly motivated computer science student, with a great interest in Web development and Cybersecurity. I'm currently studying at Trent University and I'm enrolled in the Honors Co-op program. I've completed my first year and I'm currently taking a full course load in the summer as well.   </h3>
    <h3>I have a passion for learning languages, both linguistic, and programming languages. I  enjoy coding in C# and Java (my two stronger languages) and I'm comfortable with Python and MIPS assembly. I have bilingual/native profienciency in Hungarian and English, and I'm fluent in French (thanks to the 13 years of french immersion schooling). I'm currently learning Spanish with elementary proficiency.
